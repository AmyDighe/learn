# learn 0.0.1.9000

* `render_new_rmds_to_md()` and `rerender()` gain the option `solution = TRUE`
  to render solutions documents that will live in the `/solutions` subpage with
  the same name as the practicals that live in the `/posts` subpage. They will
  link to the figures in the `static/posts` directory to avoid duplication.
* `xfun` added to package imports
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
