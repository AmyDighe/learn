# On reproducibility


## What is reproducibility in science?

<center><img src="../../img/slides/printing-press.jpg" width="60%"></center>
<br>

- ability to reproduce results by a peer
- requires <font color="#99004d">data</font>, <font color="#99004d">methods</font>, and <font color="#99004d">procedures</font>
- increasingly, science is supposed to be reproducible






## Why does it not happen, in practice?

  Some opinions on whether reproducibility is needed:
  
- *Ideally, yes but we don't have time for this.*
- *If it gets published, yes.*
- *If it gets published, yes; unless it is in PLoS One...*
- *No need: I work on my own.*
- *For others to copy us? You crazy?!*
- *No way! We rigged the data, the method does not work, and we ran the analyses in Excel.*





## Main obstacles to reproducibility {.columns-2}

<center><img src="../../img/slides/wecandoit.jpg" width="85%"></center>

- lack of time: ultimately, reproducibility is faster
- fear of plagiarism: low risks in practice
- internal work, no need to share: almost never true
- one good reason: <font color="#99004d">lack of tools to facilitate reproducibility</font>
