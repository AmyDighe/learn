# Context

On 26 June 1998, the St Sebastian High School in Stegen (school A), Germany,
celebrated a graduation party, where 250 to 350 participants were
expected. Attendants included graduates from that school, their families and
friends, teachers, 12th grade students, and some graduates from a nearby school
(school B).

A self-service party buffet was supplied by a commercial caterer in
Freiburg. Food was prepared on the day of the party and transported in a
refrigerated van to the school.

Festivities started with a dinner buffet open from 8.30 pm onwards and were
followed by a dessert buffet offered from 10 pm. The party and the buffet
extended late during the night and alcoholic beverages were quite popular. All
agreed it was a party to be remembered.



## The alert

On 2nd July 1998, the Freiburg local health office reported to the Robert Koch
Institute (RKI) in Berlin the occurrence of many cases of gastroenteritis
following the graduation party described above. More than 100 cases were
suspected among participants and some of them were admitted to nearby
hospitals. Sick people suffered from fever, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting
lasting for several days. Most believed that the tiramisu consumed at dinner was
responsible for their illness. *Salmonella enteritidis* was isolated from 19
stool samples.

The Freiburg health office sent a team to investigate the kitchen of the
caterer. Food preparation procedures were reviewed. Food samples, except
tiramisu (none was left over), were sent to the laboratory of Freiburg
University. Microbiological analyses were performed on samples of the following:
brown chocolate mousse, caramel cream, remoulade sauce, yoghurt dill sauce, and
10 raw eggs.

The Freiburg health office requested help from the RKI in the investigation to
assess the magnitude of the outbreak and identify potential vehicle(s) and risk
factors for transmission in order to better control the outbreak.



## The epidemiological study

**Case definition**: cases were defined as any person who had attended the party
at St Sebastian High School and who suffered from *diarrhoea* (min. 3 loose
stool for 24 hours) between 27 June and 29 June 1998, or from at least three of
the following symptoms: *vomiting*, *fever over 38.5Â° C*, *nausea*, 
*abdominal pain*, *headache*.

Students from both schools attending the party were asked through phone
interviews to provide names of persons who attended the party.

Overall, 291 responded to enquiries and 103 cases were identified. The linelist
analysed in this case study was built from these 291 responses.


## This case study

In this case study, we will take you through the analysis of this epidemic. This
will be the occasion to illustrate more generally useful practices for data
analysis using **R**, including:

- how to read data from Excel
- how to explore data using tables and summaries
- how to clean data
- how to make graphics to describe the data
- how to test if specific food items are linked to the disease





# Initial data processing

## Loading required packages

The following packages will be used in the case study:

- `here`: to find the path to data or script files
- `readxl`: to read Excel spreadsheets into **R**
- `incidence`: to build epicurves

To avoid having to specify the name of the package whenever we use a function
using the syntax `package_name::function_name()`, we load these packages using
`library`:

```{r stegen_libraries}
library(here) # find data/script files
library(readxl) # read xlsx files
library(incidence) # make epicurves
library(epitrix) # clean labels and variables
library(dplyr) # general data handling
library(ggplot2) # advanced graphics
```

Note that you will get an error if the packages have not been installed on your
system. To install them (you only need to do this once!), type:

```{r stegen_install_libraries, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("incidence")
install.packages("epitrix")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


Loading these packages makes all functions implemented by the packages
available, so that `function_name()` can be used directly (without the
`package_name::` prefix). This is not a problem here as these packages do now
implement functions with identical names.



## Importing data from Excel

Linelist data can be read from various formats, including flat text files
(e.g. `.txt`, `.csv`), other statistical software (e.g. STATA) or Excel
spreadsheets. We illustrate the latter, which is probably the most common
format.  We assume that the data file `stegen_raw.xlsx` has been saved in a
`data/` folder of your project, and that your current R session is at the root
of the project.


Here we decompose the steps to read data in: finding the path to the data
(`path_to_data`), using the function `read_xlsx` to read data in, and saving the
output in a new object `stegen`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
path_to_data <- here("data", "stegen_raw.xlsx")
stegen <- read_xlsx(path_to_data)
```

```{r stegen_read_data, results = 'hide', echo = FALSE}
stegen <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("static", "data", "stegen_raw.xlsx"))
```

To print the content of the dataset, we can use either of these commands:
```{r stegen_print_data, eval = 1}
stegen
View(stegen)
```

If the above fails, you should check:

- that your data file has been saved in the right folder, with the right name
  (lower case and upper case do matter)
- that your R session was started from the right project - if unsure, close R
and re-open Rstudio by double-clicking on the `.Rproj` file 
- that all packages are installed and loaded (see installation guidelines above)

</p>
</div>
</div>




## Overview and summaries

We first have a quick look at the content of the data set. The information we are looking for is:

- the numbers of cases (rows) and variables (columns) in the data
- the *name* of the variables: do they use consistent capitalisation and separators?
- the *type* of the variables: are dates, numeric or categorical variables used when they should?
- the *coding* of the variables: are explicit labels (e.g. `"male"`/`"female"`) used where relevant?

We first check the dimensions of the `stegen` object, and the name of the variables:
```{r stegen_dim}
dim(stegen) # rows x columns
names(stegen) # column labels
```

We can now try and summarise the dataset using:
```{r stegen_summary}
summary(stegen)
```

Note that binary variables, when treated as numeric values (0/1), are summarised
at such, which may not always be useful. As an alternative, `table` can be used
to list all possible values of a variable, and count how many time each value
appears in the data. For instance, we can compare the `summary` and `table` for
consumption of `tiramisu`:
```{r stegen_summary_table}
stegen$tiramisu # all values
summary(stegen$tiramisu) # summary
table(stegen$tiramisu) # table
```


**Good news**: the dataset has the expected dimensions, and all the relevant
variables seem to be present. There are, however, **a few issues**: 

1. variable names are a bit messy, and include different separators, spaces, and
  irregular capitalisation
2. variable types are partly wrong: 
    - *unique keys* should be `character` (i.e. character strings)
    - *dates of onset* should be `Date` (**R** is good at handling actual dates)
    - *illness* and *sex* should be `factor` (i.e. a categorical variables)
3. labels used in some variables are ambiguous:
    - *sex* should be coded explicitely, not as 0 (here, male) and 1 (here,
      female)
	- *illness* should be coded explicitely, not as 0 (here, non-case) and 1 (case)
4. some binary variables have maximum values of 9 (see `summary(stegen)`)


## Data cleaning

While it is tempting to go back to the Excel spreadsheet to fix issues with
data, it is almost always quicker and more reliable to clean data in **R**
directly. Here, we make a copy of the old data set, and clean `stegen` before
further analysis.

```{r stegen_old}
stegen_old <- stegen # save 'dirty data'
```

We use `epitrix`'s function `clean_labels` to standardise the variable names:
```{r stegen_clean_labels}
new_labels <- clean_labels(names(stegen)) # generate standardised labels
new_labels # check the result
names(stegen) <- new_labels
```

We set convert the unique identifiers to character strings (`character`), dates
of onset to actual `Date` objects, and sex and illness are set to categorical variables (`factor`):
```{r stegen_unique_ids}
stegen$unique_key <- as.character(stegen$unique_key)
stegen$sex <- factor(stegen$sex)
stegen$ill <- factor(stegen$ill)
stegen$date_onset <- as.Date(stegen$date_onset)
```

We use the function `recode` from the `dplyr' package to recode `sex` more
explicitely:
```{r stegen_recode}
stegen$sex <- recode_factor(stegen$sex, "0" = "male", "1" = "female")
stegen$ill <- recode_factor(stegen$ill, "0" = "non case", "1" = "case")
```


Finally we look in more depth into these variables having maximum values of 9,
where we expect 0/1; `table` is useful to list all values taken by a variable,
and listing their frequencies:

```{r stegen_nines}

table(stegen$pork)
table(stegen$salmon)
table(stegen$horseradish)

```

The only rogue values are `9`; they are likely either data entry issues, or
missing data, which in **R** should be coded as `NA` ("not available"). We can
replace these values using:

```{r stegen_replace_9}
stegen$pork[stegen$pork == 9] <- NA
stegen$salmon[stegen$salmon == 9] <- NA
stegen$horseradish[stegen$horseradish == 9] <- NA
```

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stegen_help_2">Why does this work?</button>
  <div id="stegen_help_2" class="collapse">

<p>
There are several things going on in a command like:
```{r eval = FALSE}
stegen$pork[stegen$pork == 9] <- NA
```

let us break them down:

1. `stegen$pork` means "get the variable called `pork` in the dataset `stegen`"
2. `[...]` subset the vector according to `...`; if `...` is a series of
   `TRUE/FALSE` values, only entries corresponding to `TRUE` are retained
3. `... == 9` for each value of `...`  test if it is equal to `9`, and return `TRUE` if so (`FALSE` otherwise) 
4. `... <- NA` replace `...` with `NA` (missing value)

in other words: "isolate the entries of `stegen$pork` which equal `9`, and
replace them with `NA`; here is another toy example to illustrate the procedure:

```{r stegen_subset}
## make toy input vector
toy_vector <- 1:5
toy_vector

## make toy logical vector for subsetting
toy_logical <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
toy_logical
toy_vector[toy_logical] # subset values
toy_vector[toy_logical] <- 0 # replace subset values
toy_vector # check outcome

```

# Data exploration


## Summaries of age and sex distribution

We can have a brief look at age and sex distributions using some basic
summaries; for instance:
```{r stegen_age_sex}
summary(stegen$age) # age stats
summary(stegen$sex) # gender distribution
tapply(stegen$age, stegen$sex, summary) # age stats by gender      
```

<div class="container">

  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stegen_help_3">More about `tapply`</button>
  <div id="stegen_help_3" class="collapse">

<p>

`tapply` is a very handy function to stratify any kind of analyses. You will
find more details by reading the documentation of the function `?tapply`, but
briefly, the syntax to be used is `tapply(input_data, stratification,
function_to_use, optional_arguments)`. In the command used above:
```{r eval = FALSE}
tapply(stegen$age, stegen$sex, summary)
```

this literally means: select the age variable in the dataset `stegen`
(`stegen$age`), stratify it by sex (`stegen$sex`), and summaries each strata
(`summary`). So for instance, to get the average age by sex (function `mean`), one could use:
```{r stegen_age_per_sex}
tapply(stegen$age, stegen$sex, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Here we illustrate that further arguments to the function can be passed as extra
arguments; here, `na.rm = TRUE` means "ignore missing data".

</p>

</div>
</div>



## Graphical exploration

The summaries above may be useful for reporting purposes, but graphics are
usually better for getting a feel for the data. Here, we illustrate how the
package `ggplot2` can be used to derive informative graphics of age/sex
distribution. It implements an alternative graphics system to the basic **R**
plots, in which the plot is built by adding (literally using `+`) different
layers of information, using:

- `ggplot()` to specify the dataset to use
- `geom_...()` functions which define a type of graphics to use (e.g. barplot, histogram)
- `aes()` to map elements of the data into aesthetic properties (e.g. x/y axes, color, shape)

For instance, to get an histogram of age:

```{r stegen_histogram}
ggplot(stegen) + geom_histogram(aes(x = age))
```

Color can be added using:
```{r stegen_histogram_sex}
ggplot(stegen) + geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex))
```

Here, the age distribution is pretty much identical between male and female.

  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stegen_help_4">More on `ggplot2`</button>
  <div id="stegen_help_4" class="collapse">

<p>

`ggplot2` graphics are highly customisable, and a lot of help and examples can
be found online. The [official website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a good place to start.

For instance, here we:

- add white borders to the plot (`color = "white"`)
- specify colors manually for male / female, using specified color codes (see
  [html color picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to
  define your own colors) (`scale_fill_manual(...)`)
- adding labels for title, *x* and *y* axes (`labs()`)
- specify a lighter general color theme, using Times font of a larger size by default (`theme_light(...)`)
- move the legend inside the plot (`theme(...)`)

```{r stegen_ggplot2_custom}
ggplot(stegen) + geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = sex), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(male = "#4775d1", female = "#cc6699")) +
  labs(title = "Age distribution by gender", x = "Age (years)", y = "Number of cases") +
  theme_light(base_family = "Times", base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8))
```

</p>

</div>
</div>


## Epidemic curve

Incidence curves can be built using the package `incidence`, which will compute
the number of new cases given a vector of dates (here, onset) and a time
interval (1 day by default). We use the function `incidence` to achieve this, and
then visualise the results:

```{r stegen_incidence}
i <- incidence(stegen$date_onset)
i
plot(i)
```

Details of the case counts can be obtained using:
```{r stegen_case_counts}
as.data.frame(i)
```

How long is this outbreak? It looks like most cases occurred over the course of
3 days, but that cases kept showing up 10 days after the peak. Is this true? Not
really. Stratifying the epidemic curve by case definition will clarify the
situation:

```{r incidence_stratified}
i_ill <- incidence(stegen$date_onset, group = stegen$ill)
i_ill
as.data.frame(i_ill)
plot(i_ill, color = c("non case" = "#66cc99", "case" = "#990033"))
```

The outbreak really only happened over 3 days: onsets reported after did not
match the epi case definition. This is compatible with a food-borne outbreak
with limited or no person-to-person transmission.


Note that the plots produced by `incidence` are `ggplot2` objects, so that the
options seen before can be used for further customisation (see below).


<div class="container">

  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stegen_help_5">More on `incidence`</button>
  <div id="stegen_help_5" class="collapse">

<p>

More information on the `incidence` package can be found from the
[dedicated website](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/). Here, we illustrate how incidence can be stratified e.g. by case definition:

We can also customise this graphic like other `ggplot2` plots (see [this tutorial](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/articles/customize_plot.html) for more):

```{r incidence_stratified_custom}
plot(i_ill, border = "white") + scale_fill_manual(values = c(male = "#4775d1", female = "#cc6699")) +
  labs(title = "Epicurve by gender", x = "Date of onset", y = "Number of cases") +
  theme_light(base_family = "Times", base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

</p>

</div>
</div>



## Age and gender distribution of the cases

We use the same principles as before to visualise the distribution of illness by
age and gender. To split the plot into different panels according to `sex`, we
use `facet_grid()` (see previous extra info on `ggplot2` customisation for
further details otions):

```{r stegen_case_age_sex}
ggplot(stegen) + geom_histogram(aes(x = age, fill = ill)) +
  scale_fill_manual("Illness", values = c("non case" = "#66cc99", "case" = "#990033")) +
  facet_grid(sex ~ .) + labs(title = "Cases by age and gender") + theme_light()
```

Illness does not seem to be depending on age or gender. This can be tested: this
is the topic of the next and final section.



# Looking for the culprits

## Univariate tests

Methods for testing the association between two variables can be broken down in 3 types,
depending on which types these variables are:

1. **2 quantitative variables**: Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$) and similar
  methods
2. **1 quantitative, 1 categorical**: ANOVA types of approaches; particular case with
  2 groups: Student's$t$-test
3. **2 categorical variables**: Chi-squared test on the 2x2 table
  (a.k.a. *contingency* table) and similar methods (e.g. Fisher's exact test)


We can use these approaches to test if the disease is linked to any of the other
recorded variables. As illness itself is a categorical variable, only approaches
of type 2 and 3 will be illustrated here.


### Is illness linked to age?

We can use the function `t.test` to test if the average age is different across
illness status. As this test assumes that the two categories exhibit similar
variation, we first ensure that the variances are comparable using Bartlett's
test. The syntax`variable ~ group` is used to indicate the variable of interest (left hand-side), and the group
 (right hand-side):

```{r stegen_bartlett_test}
bartlett.test(stegen$age ~ stegen$ill)
```

The resulting p-value (`r round(bartlett.test(stegen$age ~ stegen$ill)[["p.value"]], 3)`) suggests the variances are indeed comparable. Wecan thus proceed to a $t$-test:


```{r stegen_bartlett_test}
t.test(stegen$age ~ stegen$ill, var.equal = TRUE)
```

The p-value of `r round(t.test(stegen$age ~ stegen$ill, var.equal = TRUE)[["p.value"]], 3)` confirms the previous graphics: the illness does not seem to be linked to age.



### Is illness linked to gender?

To test the association between gender and illness (2 categorical variables), we
first build a 2-by-2 (contingency) table, using:

```{r stegen_2by2}
tab_ill_sex <- table(stegen$ill, stegen$sex)
tab_ill_sex
```

Note that proportions can be obtained using `prop.table`:
```{r stegen_prop_table}
## basic proportions
prop.table(tab_ill_sex)

## expressed in %, rounded:
round(100 * prop.table(tab_ill_sex))
```

Once a contingency table has been built, the Chi-square test can be run using `chisq.test`:
```{r stegen_chisq}
chisq.test(tab_ill_sex)
```

Here, the p-value of `r round(chisq.test(tab_ill_sex)[["p.value"]], 3)` suggests illness is not related to sex either.
