This case study simulates the early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola
Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. It covers various aspects of analysis of the early
stage of an outbreak, and provides an introduction to transmission chain
reconstruction using *outbreaker2*.

# Installing required packages

The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this case study:

- [`incidence`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) for epicurves
- [`epicontacts`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) for contact data visualisation
  
To install these packages, use `install.packages`, e.g.:
   
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("incidence")
install.packages("epicontacts")
```

We will also use several packages currently under development, hosted on *github*. These include:
   
- [`distcrete`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/distcrete) to obtain discrete time delay distributions
- [`epitrix`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix) for some practical tricks
- [`earlyR`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/earlyR) to estimate $R_0$ 
- [`projections`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/projections) to derive short term incidence predictions
- [`outbreaker2`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2) to reconstruct the outbreak
   
   
To install these, you will need a working version of `devtools`, and the
toolchain for package building on your system. On windows, you will likely need
to install [*Rtools*](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
   
```{r install2, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/distcrete")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/epitrix")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/earlyR")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/projections")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/outbreaker2")
```
