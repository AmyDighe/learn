This case study simulates the early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola
Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. It covers various aspects of analysis of the early
stage of an outbreak, and provides an introduction to transmission chain
reconstruction using *outbreaker2*.

# Installing required packages

The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this case study:

- [`xlsx`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) to read `.xlsx` files
- [`incidence`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) for epicurves
- [`epicontacts`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) for contact data visualisation
  
To install these packages, use `install.packages`, e.g.:
   
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("xlsx")
install.packages("incidence")
install.packages("epicontacts")
```

We will also use several packages currently under development, hosted on *github*. These include:
   
- [`distcrete`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/distcrete) to obtain discrete time delay distributions
- [`epitrix`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix) for some practical tricks
- [`earlyR`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/earlyR) to estimate $R_0$ 
- [`projections`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/projections) to derive short term incidence predictions
- [`outbreaker2`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2) to reconstruct the outbreak
   
   
To install these, you will need a working version of `devtools`, and the
toolchain for package building on your system. On windows, you will likely need
to install [*Rtools*](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
   
```{r install2, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("reconhub/distcrete")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/epitrix")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/earlyR")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/projections")
devtools::install_github("reconhub/outbreaker2")
```


	
# A novel EVD outbreak in Ankh, Republic of Morporkia

A new EVD outbreak has been notified in the small city of Ankh, located in the
Northern, rural district of the Republic of Morporkia. Public Health Morporkia
(PHM) is in charge of coordinating the outbreak response, and have contracted
you as a consultant in epidemics analysis to inform the response in real time.

    
## Early data
	
While a new data update is pending, you have been given the following linelist
and contact data, from the early stages of the outbreak:

- [**PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx**](../../data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx):
  a linelist containing case information up to the 27th October 2017

- [**PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx**](../../data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx):
  a list of contacts reported between cases up to the 27th October 2017, where
  `from` indicates a potential source of infection, and `to` the recipient of
  the contact.
  

To read into R, download these files and use the function `read.xlsx()` from the
`xlsx` package to import the data. Each import will create a `data.frame`. Call
the first one `linelist`, and the second one `contacts`. For instance, you first
command line could look like:
	
```{r eval = FALSE}
linelist <- xlsx::read.xlsx("PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
```


Once imported, the data should look like:
          
```{r read_files, echo = -c(1,2)}
linelist <- xlsx::read.xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
contacts <- xlsx::read.xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)

## linelist: one line per case
linelist

## contacts: pairs of cases with reported contacts
contacts
```


## A first look at contacts

Contact tracing is at the centre of an Ebola outbreak response. Using the
function `make_epicontacts` in the `epicontacts` package, create a new
`epicontacts` object called `x`. The result should look like:
	      
```{r epicontacts, echo = -c(1,2)}
library(epicontacts)
x <- make_epicontacts(linelist,
                      contacts, directed = TRUE)
x
```  

You can easily plot these contacts, but with a little bit of tweaking (see
`?vis_epicontacts`) you can customise shapes by gender:

```{r epicontacts_plot}
plot(x, node_shape = "sex", shapes = c(male = "male", female = "female"), selector = FALSE)

```

**What can you say about these contacts?**
     

     
## Looking at incidence curves

The first question PHM asks you is simply: *how bad is it?*. Given that this is
a terrible disease, with a mortality rate nearing 70%, there is a lot of concern
about this outbreak getting out of control. The first step of the analysis lies
in drawing an *epicurve*, i.e. an plot of incidence over time.

<br>

Using the package `incidence`, compute daily incidence based on the dates of
symptom onset. Store the result in an object called `i`; the result should look
like:

```{r incidence, echo = -c(1,2)}
library(incidence)
i <- incidence(linelist$onset)
i
plot(i)
```

If you pay close attention to the dates on the x-axis, you may notice that
something is missing. Indeed, the graph stops right after the last case, while
the data should be complete until the 27th October 2017. You can remedy this
using the argument `last_date` in the `incidence` function:
      

```{r incidence_rectif}
i <- incidence(linelist$onset, last_date = as.Date("2017-10-27"))
i
plot(i)
```

The simplest model of incidence is probably the log-linear model, i.e. a linear
regression on log-transformed incidences. In the `incidence` package, the
function `fit` will estimate the parameters of this model from an incidence
object (here, `i`). Apply it to the data and store the result in a new object
called `f`. You can print `f` to derive estimates of the growth rate $r$ and the
doubling time, and add the corresponding model to the incidence plot:

```{r fit}
f <- fit(i)
f
plot(i, fit = f)
```

**How would you interpret this result? What criticism would you make on this
  model?**

As an aid for interpretation, you are reminded of previous observations of the
serial interval distribution, estimated during the West African EVD outbreak
(WHO Ebola Response Team (2014) NEJM 371:1481–1495) with a mean of 15.3 days and
a standard deviation 9.3 days.
     


## Estimating $R$

The transmissibility of the disease can be assessed through the estimation of
the reproduction number $R$, defined as the number of expected secondary cases
per infected case. In the early stages of an outbreak, and assuming no immunity
in the population, this quantity is also the basic reproduction number $R_0$,
i.e. $R$ in a fully susceptible population. 

<br>

The package `earlyR` implements a simple maximum-likelihood estimation of $R$,
using dates of onset of symptoms and information on the serial interval
distribution. It is a simpler but less flexible version of the model by Cori et
al (2013, AJE 178: 1505–1512) implemented in
[`EpiEstim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html). 

<br>

Briefly, `earlyR` uses a simple model describing incidence on a given day as a
Poisson process determined by a global force of infection on that day:
$$
x_t \sim \mathcal{P} (\lambda_t)
$$

where $x_t$ is the incidence (based on symptom onset) on day $t$ and $\lambda_t$
is the force of infection. Noting $R$ the reproduction number and $w()$ the
discrete serial interval distribution, we have:

$$
\lambda_t = R * \sum_{s=1}^t x_s w(t - s)
$$

The likelihood (probability of observing the data given the model and
parameters) is defined as a function of $R$:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x)  = p(x | R) = \prod_{t=1}^T F_{\mathcal{P}}(x_t, \lambda_t)
$$

where $F_{\mathcal{P}}$ is the Poisson probability mass function.

<br>

Using the estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval
provided in the previous section, use the function `get_R` to estimate the
reproduction number, specifying a maximum R of 10 (see ?`get_R`) and store the
result in a new object `R`:

```{r estimate-R, echo = FALSE}

library(earlyR)
mu <- 15.3 # mean in days days
sigma <- 9.3 # standard deviation in days
R <- get_R(i, si_mean = mu, si_sd = sigma, max_R = 10)

```

You can visualise the results as follows:

```{r plot-r}
R
plot(R)
plot(R, "lambdas")
abline(v = linelist$onset, lty = 2)

```

The first figure shows the distribution of likely values of *R*, and the
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation. The second figure shows the global force of
infection over time, with dashed bars indicating dates of onset of the cases.

**Interpret these results: what do you make of the reproduction number? What does
it reflect? Based on the last part of the epicurve, some colleagues suggest that
incidence is going down and the outbreak may be under control. What is your
opinion on this?**
