## Introduction

This practical is the third (and last) part of a practical which simulates the
early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak.
Please make sure you have gone through [part 1](./real-time-response-1.html) and [part 2](./real-time-response-2.html) before starting [part 3](./real-time-response-3.html).  In
part 3 of the practical, we give an introduction to transmission chain
reconstruction using `outbreaker2`.

> Note: This practical is derived from earlier practicals called [Ebola
> simulation part 1: early outbreak assessment](./simulated-evd-early.html) and
> [Ebola simulation part 2: outbreak
> reconstruction](./practical-ebola-reconstruction.html)

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this practical ([part 3](./real-time-response-3.html)), you should be able to:

- Use the `outbreaker2` package to reconstruct who infected whom using
  epidemiological and genetic data
- Understand how different types of data contribute to our understanding of who
  infected whom
- Interpret the various outputs from `outbreaker2`, and understand the uncertainty
  associated with any conclusions you draw
- Visualise a consensus tree using epicontacts

## Context: A novel EVD outbreak in a fictional country in West Africa

A new EVD outbreak has been notified in a fictional country in West Africa. The
Ministry of Health is in charge of coordinating the outbreak response, and have
contracted you as a consultant in epidemic analysis to inform the response in
real time. You have already done descriptive and statistical analyses of the
data to understand the overall epidemic trend ([part 1](./real-time-response-1.html) and [part 2](./real-time-response-2.html) of the
practical). Now we will try and draw a more detailed picture of the epidemic by
trying to infer who infected whom using the data available to us, namely dates
of symptom onset, whole genome sequences (WGS) and limited contact data. This
can be achieved using `outbreaker2`, which provides a modular platform for
outbreak reconstruction.

## Required packages 

The following packages, available on CRAN or github, are needed for this analysis.
You should have installed them in [part 1](./real-time-response-1.html) and [part 2](./real-time-response-2.html) but if not, install necessary packages as follows:

```{r install_packages, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
# install.packages("readxl")
# install.packages("outbreaks")
# install.packages("incidence")
# remotes::install_github("reconhub/epicontacts@ttree")
# install.packages("distcrete")
# install.packages("epitrix")
# remotes::install_github("annecori/EpiEstim")
# install.packages("projections")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("magrittr")
# install.packages("binom")
# install.packages("ape")
# install.packages("outbreaker2")
# install.packages("here")
```

Once the packages are installed, you may need to open a new R session. Then load the libraries as follows:

```{r load_library, warning = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(outbreaks)
library(incidence)
library(epicontacts)
library(distcrete)
library(epitrix)
library(EpiEstim)
library(projections)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(binom)
library(ape)
library(outbreaker2)
library(here)
```

## Read in the data processed in [part 1](./real-time-response-1.html) and [part 2](./real-time-response-2.html)

<!--
ZNK: These two chunks are needed because of the way the documents are structured
in blogdown. The source that we edit is not the same as the site that is
rendered. Everything in this directory will end up in the same directory as the
"static" when the website is displayed, but the current directory structure is
present when the practicals are built, so we have to do this silly 
song-and-dance to appease the directory gods.
-->

```{r read_data_ni, include = FALSE}
linelist <- readRDS(here("static/data/clean/linelist.rds"))
linelist_clean <- readRDS(here("static/data/clean/linelist_clean.rds"))
epi_contacts <- readRDS(here("static/data/clean/epi_contacts.rds"))
si <- readRDS(here("static/data/clean/si.rds"))
dna <- read.FASTA(here("static/data/wgs_20140707.fasta"))
```

```{r read_data, eval = FALSE}
linelist <- readRDS(here("data/clean/linelist.rds"))
linelist_clean <- readRDS(here("data/clean/linelist_clean.rds"))
epi_contacts <- readRDS(here("data/clean/epi_contacts.rds"))
si <- readRDS(here("data/clean/si.rds"))
```

### Importing Whole Genome Sequences (WGS)

WGS have been obtained for all cases in this outbreak. They are stored as a
`fasta` [wgs_20140707.fasta](../../data/wgs_20140707.fasta). Download this
file, save it in your working directory, and then import these data using the
function `read.FASTA` from the `ape` package. Do the sequence labels match the
IDs in your cleaned linelist?

```{r read_dna, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dna <- read.FASTA(here("data/wgs_20140707.fasta"))
dna
```

```{r show_dna, echo = FALSE}
dna
```


```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
identical(labels(dna), linelist_clean$case_id) # check sequences match linelist data
```

Subset the genetic data to keep only the sequences that match your cleaned
linelist, and check again that the sequence labels match. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
dna <- dna[match(linelist_clean$case_id, names(dna))]
identical(labels(dna), linelist_clean$case_id)
```

### Building delay distributions

`outbreaker2` can handle different types of dates. When dates of onset are
provided, information on the *generation time* (delay between primary and
secondary infections) and on the *incubation period* (delay between infection and
symptom onset) must be provided. For this practical we will assume that 
the generation time can be approximated using the serial interval, which you have
already estimated above and stored in the object `si`.

How are the generation time and serial interval related? How might they differ?

```{r gentime_incub, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- the generation time is the delay between infection times of transmission pairs,
    whereas the serial interval is the delay between times of symptom onset
- the serial interval captures the delay between infection times *and* 
    the delays from infection times to symptom onset
- the serial interval distribution therefore generally has a larger variance than 
    the generation time distribution")
```

The incubation period can be estimated from the linelist data by calculating 
the delay between dates of symptom onset and dates of infection, which are known
for some cases. Visualise the distribution of incubation periods using a histogram.

```{r incubation}
incub_obs <- as.integer(na.omit(with(linelist_clean, date_of_onset - date_of_infection)))
summary(incub_obs)

hist(incub_obs, breaks = 0:40,
     xlab = "Days after infection", ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Incubation period (empirical distribution)",
     col = "grey", border = "white")
```

As for the serial interval, use the function `fit_disc_gamma` to 
fit a Gamma distribution to these empirical estimates.

```{r incubation_fit}
incub_fit <- fit_disc_gamma(incub_obs)
incub_fit
incub <- incub_fit$distribution
```

Compare this distribution to the empirical data to make sure the results seem
reasonable:

```{r incubation_compare}
hist(incub_obs, xlab = "Days after infection", ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Incubation period: fit to data", col = "salmon", border = "white",
     50, ylim = c(0, 0.15), freq = FALSE, breaks = 0:40)
points(0:60, incub$d(0:60), col = "#9933ff", pch = 20)
points(0:60, incub$d(0:60), col = "#9933ff", type = "l", lty = 2)
```

An alternative approach here would be to use estimates of the *mean* and *standard
deviation* of the incubation period and the generation time published in the
literature. From this, one would need to use `epitrix` to convert these
parameters into *shape* and *scale* for a Gamma distribution, and then use
`distcrete` to generate discretised distributions.

### Using the original `outbreaker` model

The original `outbreaker` model combined temporal information (here, dates of
onset) with sequence data to infer who infected whom. Here, we use `outbreaker2`
to apply this model to the data. 

All inputs to the new `outbreaker` function are prepared using dedicated
functions, which make a number of checks on provided inputs and define defaults.
Make sure you names the dates vector, so the DNA labels can be linked to their
respective cases:

```{r data-basic-outbreaker}

dates <- linelist_clean$date_of_onset
names(dates) <- linelist_clean$case_id
data <- outbreaker_data(dates = dates, # dates of onset
                        dna = dna, # WGS
                        w_dens = si$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )

```

We also create a configuration, which determines different aspects of the
analysis, including which parameters need to be estimated, initial values of
parameters, the length of the MCMC, etc. If you want see a progress bar to
indicate how long the analysis will take, add an additional option `pb = TRUE`:

```{r config-outbreaker}

ob_config <- create_config(move_kappa = FALSE, # don't look for missing cases
                           move_pi = FALSE, # don't estimate reporting
                           init_pi = 1, # set reporting to 1
                           find_import = FALSE, # don't look for additional imported cases
                           init_tree = "star" # star-like tree as starting point
                           )

```

We can now run the analysis. This should take a couple of minutes on modern
laptops. Note the use of `set.seed(0)` to have identical results across
different users and computers:

```{r outbreaker-basic, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(0)
res_basic <- outbreaker(data = data, config = ob_config)
res_basic
plot(res_basic)
plot(res_basic, burn = 500)

```

The first two plots show the trace of the log-posterior densities (with, and
without burnin). See `?plot.outbreaker_chains` for details on available
plots. Graphics worth looking at include:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_1}

## ancestry plot
## axis labels are removed because they are too small to make out
plot(res_basic,
     type = "alpha",
     burnin = 500) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

## infection dates
plot(res_basic,
     type = "t_inf",
     burnin = 500) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

# mutation rate
plot(res_basic, "mu", burn = 500, type = "density")
```


```{r, ebola_outbreaker_1-net, eval = FALSE}

# transmission trees
p <- plot(res_basic,
          type = "network",
          burnin = 500,
          min_support = .05) 
p
```

```{r, ebola_outbreaker_1-ns, echo = FALSE}
# transmission trees
p <- plot(res_basic,
          type = "network",
          burnin = 500,
          min_support = .05) 
learn::save_and_use_widget(p, "real-time-response-network-1.html")

```

Explain briefly what each of these plots shows, and what (if any) conclusions
can be drawn from them.

```{r posterior_dist, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- The `alpha` plot shows the posterior probability of one case infecting another.
Some ancestries are clearly well resolved (large circles), whereas others are not.
The clustering of circles into rectangles suggests there are clusters of unresolved
cases (in this case, the genetically identical cases)
- The `t_inf` plot shows the posterior distribution of infection times. For most cases, 
this distribution is quite flat
- The `mu` plot simply shows the posterior distribution of mutation rate estimates.
It is unimodal around 6e-6
- The `network` plot shows a network of likely infectious relationships between cases.
You can see the clustering of cases that correspond to genetically identical cases.
")
```

As a further help for interpretation, you can derive a consensus tree from the
posterior samples of trees using `summary`. Look in particular at the *support*
column.

```{r outbreaker-basic-summary}
smry_basic <- summary(res_basic)
head(smry_basic$tree)
tail(smry_basic$tree)
hist(smry_basic$tree$support, col = "grey", border = "white",
     main = "Consensus ancestry: support", xlim = c(0,1))
```

How would you interpret this result? How well resolved is the transmission tree?

```{r tree_resolution, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- The tree is fairly poorly resolved, as most ancestries have <0.5 posterior support
- The genetic data can resolve the outbreak into clusters of identical cases,
but not beyond that
")
```

As a point of comparison, repeat the same analysis using temporal data only, and
plot a graph of ancestries (`type = "alpha"`); you
should obtain something along the lines of:

```{r outbreaker-time, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(0)

data <- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist_clean$date_of_onset, # dates of onset
                        w_dens = si$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )
res_time <- outbreaker(data = data, config = ob_config)

## ancestry plot
## axis labels are removed because they are too small to make out
plot(res_time,
     type = "alpha",
     burnin = 500) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

```

Create a consensus tree, visualise the `support` values and compare to the
results when using temporal and genetic data.

```{r outbreaker-time-summary}
smry_time <- summary(res_time)
hist(smry_time$tree$support, col = "grey", border = "white",
     main = "Consensus ancestry: support", xlim = c(0,1))
```

What is the usefulness of temporal and genetic data for outbreak reconstruction?
What other data would you ideally include?

```{r data_informativeness, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- Temporal data is not very informative (especially if the generation time and
incubation period distributions are flat)
- Genetic data is more informative, but it depends on how large the clusters of
genetically identical cases are.
- Complex evolutionary behaviour will also make genetic data less informative.
- Other data: contact tracing, location data, covariates such as age, sex, occupation.
")
```

### Adding contact data to the reconstruction process

`outbreaker2` natively accepts `epicontacts` objects. Therefore all we need to
do is make an `epi_contacts_clean` object that contains contacts between cases
in `linelist_clean`, and pass it to the `ctd` argument in
`outbreaker_data`. Make sure the `epicontacts` object is defined as the 
contacts we have are directional (i.e. specify an infector and infectee).

```{r data-outbreaker-full}

## only keep linelist and contacts elements in linelist_clean
epi_contacts_clean <- epi_contacts[i = linelist_clean$case_id, ## keep linelist
                                   j = linelist_clean$case_id, ## keep contacts
                                   contacts = 'both'] ## both contacts must be in linelist
epi_contacts_clean$directed ## check directionality

data <- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist_clean$date_of_onset, # dates of onset
                        dna = dna, # dna sequences
                        ctd = epi_contacts_clean, # contact data
                        w_dens = si$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )

ob_config <- create_config(move_kappa = FALSE, # don't look for missing cases
                           move_pi = FALSE, # don't estimate reporting
                           init_pi = 1, # set reporting to 1
                           find_import = FALSE, # don't look for additional imported cases
                           init_tree = "star" # star-like tree as starting point
                           )

```

We are now ready to run the analysis. This may take a couple of minutes,
depending on your computer:

```{r outbreaker-full, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(0)
res_full <- outbreaker(data = data, config = ob_config)
res_full
```

Produce graphics as in the previous model. Assess convergence, choose an
appropriate burnin, visualise ancestries and the infection timelines:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_2, echo = FALSE}

plot(res_full) # log-posterior trace
plot(res_full, burnin = 500) # log-posterior trace

## ancestry plot
## axis labels are removed because they are too small to make out
plot(res_full,
     type = "alpha",
     burnin = 500) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

## infection dates
plot(res_full,
     type = "t_inf",
     burnin = 500) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

# transmission trees
p <- plot(res_full,
          type = "network",
          burnin = 500,
          min_support = .05) 
learn::save_and_use_widget(p, 'real-time-response-network-2.html')

```

Derive a consensus tree using `summary`, then visualise the results in the
`support` column. This time set the option `method = 'decycle'` to remove any
cycles in the consensus transmission tree.

```{r outbreaker-full-summary}

smry_full <- summary(res_full, method = 'decycle')
head(smry_full$tree)

smry_full$tree$support <- round(smry_full$tree$support, 2)

hist(smry_full$tree$support, col = "grey", border = "white",
     main = "Consensus ancestry: support", xlim = c(0,1))

```

How would you interpret the results? Compare the results to those using
temporal data only, or temporal and genetic data. Can we always rely on contact
data to estimate who infected whom?

```{r contact_data_interpret, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- Contact data clearly resolves additional transmission pairs
- However, we only have 59 contacts in an outbreak of ~160 cases; many ancestries remain unresolved
- The network plot shows the same results; we still have clusters of genetically identical cases with no contact data to further resolve them
- Infection times estimates have not improved much; we haven't integrated information on the timing of contacts to improve these estimates
- Contact data will not always be informative of transmission events:
  - in a very mixed group of people (i.e. a classroom where all children have been in contact with each other), many contacts exist between non-transmission pairs; this makes the contact data less 'specific' to transmission events
  - for diseases with long incubation periods, it can be difficult to narrow down when infection occured and know which contacts are epidemiologically relevant
  - contact tracing is resource intensive and can be inaccurate (e.g. people giving false information); quality and quantity of the data is not always assured
")
```

Now make a new `epicontacts` object to visualise the consensus tree with
meta-information. First convert the index labels in the consensus tree to the
case IDs in linelist. Also include the estimated infection time from the consensus
tree (`smry_full$tree$time`). 

```{r outbreaker-full-summary-plot}

## match index labels to case IDs
smry_full$tree$from <- linelist_clean$case_id[smry_full$tree$from]
smry_full$tree$to <- linelist_clean$case_id[smry_full$tree$to]

## convert infection time estimates from integers to dates
linelist_clean$t_inf_est <- as.Date(smry_full$tree$time,
                                    origin = min(linelist_clean$date_of_onset))

cons_tree <- make_epicontacts(linelist_clean,
                              smry_full$tree,
                              directed = TRUE)

```

In the following, we create color palettes which will be used to display
information on the final graph:

```{r consensus-tree-making}

support_pal <- colorRampPalette(
    c("#918D98", "#645877", "#423359", "#281449", "#1A0340")
)

outcome_pal <- colorRampPalette(
    c("#3288BD", "#ABDDA4")
)

```

Looking carefully at the documentation of `vis_epicontacts`, try to reproduce
the final consensus tree below:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_3, echo = FALSE}

p <- plot(cons_tree,
          edge_color = "support",
          edge_col_pal = support_pal,
          edge_label = "support",
          node_shape = "gender",
          shapes = c(m = "male", f = "female"),
          node_color = "outcome",
          col_pal = outcome_pal)

learn::save_and_use_widget(p, "real-time-response-network-3.html")
```

`epicontacts` can now also display timed transmission trees using the `method =
'ttree'` argument. In the interactive plot below, the colour of the edges represents the
posterior support, the color of the nodes the outcome, the size of the nodes
individual reproductive number R~i~.

Try adjusting the `height` and `width` arguments so the tree is cleary visible,
then explore clusters of infection by zooming in and out and moving the tree
around. Drag nodes around to improve clarity if need be. Hover your mouse over
the nodes to get more information, single-click on a node to highlight its
subtree and double-click on a node to collapse it. Set `ttree_shape =
'rectangle'` if you want a tree with right-angled edges. For more info,
see `?vis_ttree`.

```{r ebola_outbreaker_4, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

q <- plot(cons_tree,
          method = 'ttree', ## show timed tree
          x_axis = 't_inf_est', ## use 't_inf_est' column for x_axis
          edge_color = "support", ## color edges by posterior support
          edge_col_pal = support_pal, ## specify color palette 
          node_size = 'R_i', ## node size reflects R_i
          ## edge_label = "support", ## not showing for readability
          ## node_shape = "gender", ## not showing for readability
          ## shapes = c(m = "male", f = "female"), ## specify shapes
          width = 1000, ## adjust to improve readability
          height = 1500, ## adjust to improve readability
          node_color = "outcome", ## color nodes by outcome
          hide_labels = TRUE, ## don't show node labels
          date_labels = "%d/%m", ## formatting date labels
          axis_type = 'double', ## show two axes
          col_pal = outcome_pal, ## specify color palette
          node_order = 'subtree_size', ## order nodes vertically by subtree size
          reverse_node_order = TRUE, ## put large subtrees as the bottom
          ttree_shape = 'branching' ## 
          )
q
```

```{r ebola_outbreaker_4-ns, echo = FALSE}

q <- plot(cons_tree,
          method = 'ttree', ## show timed tree
          x_axis = 't_inf_est', ## use 't_inf_est' column for x_axis
          edge_color = "support", ## color edges by posterior support
          edge_col_pal = support_pal, ## specify color palette 
          node_size = 'R_i', ## node size reflects R_i

Are there any conclusions can you draw from these figures?

```{r support_final, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- Perhaps some evidence for superspreading events (e.g. 11f8ea, 9f6884, 0f58c4, f547d6); these largely capture the patterns we saw in the contact data
- No noticeable correlation with recovery status or gender (you can check this by colouring by gender or setting the shape to gender)
")
```

Now plot the consensus tree, but only including links with more than 30%
posterior support:

```{r ebola_cons_prune, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

r <- plot(cons_tree[, cons_tree$contacts$support > 0.3],
          method = 'ttree', ## show timed tree
          x_axis = 't_inf_est', ## use 't_inf_est' column for x_axis
          edge_color = "support", ## color edges by posterior support
          edge_col_pal = support_pal, ## specify color palette 
          node_size = 'R_i', ## node size reflects R_i
          ## edge_label = "support",## not showing for readability
          ## node_shape = "gender", ## not showing for readability
          ## shapes = c(m = "male", f = "female"), ## specify shapes
          width = 1000, ## adjust to improve readability
          height = 1500, ## adjust to improve readability
          node_color = "outcome", ## color nodes by outcome
          hide_labels = TRUE, ## don't show node labels
          date_labels = "%d/%m", ## formatting date labels
          axis_type = 'double', ## show two axes
          col_pal = outcome_pal, ## specify color palette
          unlinked_pos = 'middle', ## show unlinked nodes in the middle
          root_order = 't_inf_est', ## order roots by time of infection
          reverse_root_order = TRUE ## show earliest nodes at the top
          )
r

```

```{r ebola_cons_prune-ns, echo = FALSE}

r <- plot(cons_tree[, cons_tree$contacts$support > 0.3],
          method = 'ttree', ## show timed tree
          x_axis = 't_inf_est', ## use 't_inf_est' column for x_axis
          edge_color = "support", ## color edges by posterior support
          edge_col_pal = support_pal, ## specify color palette 
          node_size = 'R_i', ## node size reflects R_i
          ## edge_label = "support",## not showing for readability
          ## node_shape = "gender", ## not showing for readability
          ## shapes = c(m = "male", f = "female"), ## specify shapes
          width = 1000, ## adjust to improve readability
          height = 1500, ## adjust to improve readability
          node_color = "outcome", ## color nodes by outcome
          hide_labels = TRUE, ## don't show node labels
          date_labels = "%d/%m", ## formatting date labels
          axis_type = 'double', ## show two axes
          col_pal = outcome_pal, ## specify color palette
          unlinked_pos = 'middle', ## show unlinked nodes in the middle
          root_order = 't_inf_est', ## order roots by time of infection
          reverse_root_order = TRUE ## show earliest nodes at the top
          )
learn::save_and_use_widget(r, "real-time-response-network-prune.html")

```

Do you think we can reliably answer the question of who infected whom in this
outbreak? How can we improve our estimates?

```{r support_partial, echo = FALSE, results = render_snippet, eval = params$full_version}
cat("
- Though support for some ancestries is high, the overall outbreak is still not very well resolved --- Especially the more recent cases are poorly resolved, which are of the most interest
- More contact data would be useful (currently only have 60 reported contacts, whereas we already have genetic data and dates of sampling for all cases)
- Integrate other types of data (i.e. location, covariates such as age, gender, occupation, etc.)
")
```
